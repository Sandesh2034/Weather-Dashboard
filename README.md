# Weather Dashboard Project

## Overview

As a passionate traveler and aspiring web developer at the bootcamp, I've created a Weather Dashboard that allows users to explore the weather outlook for multiple cities. This project not only enhances my skills but also serves as a useful tool for planning trips based on real-time weather data.

## Features

### 1. Search Functionality

- Users can input a city name in the search form.
- Current and future conditions for the searched city are dynamically displayed.
- The city is added to the search history for quick reference.

### 2. Current Weather Conditions

- City name, date, and an icon representation of weather conditions are showcased.
- Temperature, humidity, and wind speed details are provided.

### 3. Future Weather Conditions

- A 5-day forecast is presented with date, icon representation, temperature, and humidity.

### 4. Search History

- Users can click on a city in the search history to view its current and future conditions.

## API Integration

The project utilizes the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data for cities. The base URL for API calls is configured as follows:

Make sure to register for an API key to access the OpenWeather API.

## Local Storage

Persistent data is stored using localStorage to maintain search history even when the browser is closed.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Obtain an API key from OpenWeather and replace `{API key}` in the base URL.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Future Improvements

- Implement responsive design for better user experience on various devices.
- Enhance error handling for API requests.
- Include additional weather details such as pressure and visibility.
